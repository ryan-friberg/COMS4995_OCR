# COMS4995_OCR
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) midterm project for COMS 4995: Applied Computer Vision at Columbia University.


OCR.py with parameters will train the residual neural network for character classification, pipeline.py will run the end-to-end system that takes multi-char images and eventually gives a series of labels of the individual characters present.

NOTE: github would not let me upload my model checkpoints because the files were too large.
